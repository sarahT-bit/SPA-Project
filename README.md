# SPA-Project
Overview: 
A randomizer; The goal is for a random word to be selected from the list. 

Functionality:
The website has 3 text boxes that the user can use to type in any animal. Then, there is a button 
that they can click on to see which word from the users list will appear on the screen. 

Choices and Challenges: 
When coding this in HTML (along with some integration of Java script) I was able to have 3 text boxes
displayed as the ouput and also have them work properly when the user clicks/types on said box. This was 
due to the implementation of:

<p> Pick words that are animals! Enter your first word!"> </p>
<input type = "text" id = "String1"> (lines 10-11) 



The challenge was trying to display a random word from the list. Whenever I tried to click on 
the button that says " Click to see", nothing would pop up.

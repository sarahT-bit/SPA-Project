# SPA-Project
Overview: 
This SPA project is meant to serve as a simple word randomizer; The goal is for a random word to be chosen from text boxes the user fills out. 

Functionality:
The website displays three seperate text boxes for the user to type in ANY ANIMAL they'd like. The program records the users answers 
and from there, the button the user clicks will trigger a response and pick any one using values in the array line in the program. 


Choices and Challenges: 

My challenge was trying to display a word from the list. When I tried to click on the button that says " Click to see", 
Nothing would pop up. It was trial and error until I finally managed to get an word displayed as the output.
It was through declaring an id after the button line in my program. It was this:
<h2 id = "Output">
  
Although, I still haven't been able to display a RANDOM word from the list. It only selects the
first one every time I run the website and I really struggled to fix it. 
I tried adding a Math.randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random(arr.length)), but nothing 
changed.
